# Pomo5 - Hack the Hill 2 Project

## About The Project

Pomo5 is a collaborative Pomodoro-style timer application developed during the 24-hour Hack the Hill 2 hackathon. It helps users manage their study sessions and breaks effectively, promoting productivity and focus while allowing for real-time synchronization across multiple devices.

### Built With

- Frontend:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- Backend:
  - Go
- Real-time Communication:
  - WebSockets
- Deployment:
  - Railway

## Features

- Interactive circular timer interface
- Adjustable study and break durations
- Real-time synchronization across devices using WebSockets
- Visually appealing design with gradient progress indicator
- Collaborative sessions with multiple users

## Technical Highlights

### Frontend Timer Logic

The frontend timer logic, including the circular interface and WebSocket communication, is implemented in JavaScript

### Backend Structure

Our Go backend is structured to handle both HTTP and WebSocket connections.

### WebSocket Implementation

We implemented real-time communication using WebSockets to ensure seamless synchronization across devices.

## The Hackathon Experience

### Challenges We Faced

It was our first time using Websockets, which are a little bit finicky. We also had tons of ideas that we weren't able to implement because of the time restriction, but we are excited to keep working!

### What We Learned

Having a working project despite learning a new technology in a short time.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of

- Creating a functional, real-time collaborative study timer in just 24 hours
- Implementing a visually appealing and interactive circular timer interface
- Successfully deploying our application with WebSocket support

### What's next for Pomo5

We are excited to continue working on it. Some features we would like to work on:
- Deploying to the cloud
- Shared To-Do list
- Customized Themes
- Spotify/Music Integration (also synced)
